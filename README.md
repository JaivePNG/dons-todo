# Don's Todo exercise

This is a quick implementation of a todo app that uses React, an Express API and a single SQLite3 table accessed through Knex.

## Caveats

* I didn't bother with any styling.
* I would refactor a few of the functions if this were production code.
* I didn't get to the step of blanking out the input field when adding a todo.
* I did *not* follow Git best practices (all in a single commit). This wasn't intentional. I was just in a hurry.
